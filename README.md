SecureSoapClient
================

The SecureSoapClient class is an extension of the native PHP SoapClient that uses cURL to make requests.

This ensures that any requests over **https** are actually secure by default.

The class otherwise acts in exactly the same way as the native SoapClient.

Usage
-----
```php
$wsdl = 'http://www.webservicex.net/CurrencyConvertor.asmx?WSDL';

// cache_path must be writeable by the web server.
$cache_path = '/cache/'; // Optional. Defaults to './wsdl_cache/'.

$Client = new \alc\SecureSoapClient($wsdl, $cache_path);

$Params = array(
    'FromCurrency' => 'GBP',
    'ToCurrency' => 'USD'
);
$Response = $Client->ConversionRate($Params);
$Rate = $Response->ConversionRateResult;
```
